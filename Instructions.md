Welcome to your first project - a Java command-line banking application! This is a great opportunity to get creative and
tackle some challenging programming problems.

You will work individually on this project, but remember, we are here to support you, and peer support is encouraged.
Let's see what you can create!

## Project Overview
Your task is to design a file database for ACME Bank and write the entire Java program using OOP principles, file
handling, exception handling, and unit testing to meet the below functional requirements.

## Technical Requirements

You should implement:

- Concrete classes
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Lambda expressions and Optionals
- Unit testing

## Functional Requirements

1. **Login Functionality**
    - User should be able to login into the system.
    - System should recognize the user and its role. (Banker/ Customer).

2. **Add New Customer**
    - Customers may have a checking account, a savings account, or both.
    - Customers should be able to set a password for their account(s).

3. **Account Transactions**
    - **Withdraw Money** (requires login)
        - From savings or checking accounts.
    - **Deposit Money** (requires login)
        - Into savings or checking accounts.
    - **Transfer Money** (requires login)
        - Between a customer's own accounts or to another customer's account.

4. **Overdraft Protection** (requires login)
    - Charge an ACME overdraft protection fee of $35 when overdrafting.
    - Prevent withdrawing more than $100 if the account balance is negative.
    - Deactivate the account after 2 overdrafts; reactivate if the customer resolves the negative balance and pays the
      overdraft fees.

## Advanced Features

5. **Display Transaction Data** (requires login)
    - Track all transactions for a customer in a separate file.
    - Display transaction history including date, type, and post-transaction balance.

6. **Password Encryption** Use password encryption. Password for the newly created account should be encrypted.

7. **Debit Card Types** 3 types of Mastercard (1 per Account).
    - Mastercard Platinum,
    - Mastercard Titanium,
    - Mastercard

- Transaction limits and benefits varies for each card.

8. **Detailed Account Statment** It Should return the total amount in the account and transactions with date and time.

9. **Filtering transactions** User can query the program and get transactions with certain conditions (e.g. today, yesterday, last week, last 7 days, last month, last 30 days and filtering on the basics of date and time).

10. **Fraud Detection** If there are 3 failed login attempts so design a mechanism to lock the account for 1 min, before trying again with the login information.
